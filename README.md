# openbook

An arbitrum-based sportsbook accepting bets in USDC. At first, openbook will
support major conventional sports (football, american football, tennis,
basketball, baseball, MMA, etc.), followed by esports & eventually simulated
sports where the participants are AIs.

Simulated sports are critical in order to always have high-quality streams
(of e.g. AI Rocket League or Starcraft) available on the platform for users to
watch together, interacting via chat, even when there are few interesting
conventional sporting events going on.

## Sportsbook transparency

All bets, user bet histories, user PnL, house PnL, house risk per match, league
& sport displayed in statistics dashboard and available in weekly DB dump.

## Token Utility

depends on size of bets).

the standard 4% vig:
